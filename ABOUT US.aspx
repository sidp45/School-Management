      <p>
    A school website is any website built, designed, and maintained by or for a school. Many school websites share certain characteristics, and some educators have developed guidelines to help schools create the best and most useful websites they can.[1]

Possible functions of a school website include:

Displaying student projects
Providing information on homework and current class assignments
Directing visitors to other resources on the web
Providing a forum for teachers, administrators, students, and parents to exchange information such as news and calendars of events
Introducing people who don't know much about the school (such as parent or students who are considering moving into the district, community members who don't have children, and teachers seeking employment) to its current events and general culture
Showing that a school is excellent with regard to sciences and new media in comparison to competitive schools
Providing a platform for internal school learning activities
Displaying school curriculum and courses
Providing staff and students with an entrance and front-end to documents and resources hosted locally
Creating and showing in public a 'corporate identity'.
